"indent-rainbow-blocks" is a Visual Studio Code extension that adds a colorful background to the indentation blocks in your code. This feature allows you to quickly visualize and navigate your code structure.

## Features

- Colorful Indentation Blocks: Adds a rainbow of colors to your code's indentation. The colors change with each level of indentation, making it easy to distinguish between different levels.

- Customization: Change the colors used for indentation blocks and the style according to your preferences.
  - Coloring example (default and custom):

  <img src="img/color_default.png" alt="Default color" style="margin-left: 40px; margin-top: 10px; margin-top: 10px; width:399; height:332">
  <img src="img/color_custom.png" alt="Custom color" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 10px; width:399; height:332">
  
  - Style example (line and fall):

  <img src="img/style_line.png" alt="Line style" style="margin-left: 40px; margin-top: 10px; width:399; height:332">
  <img src="img/style_fall.png" alt="Rainbow style" style="margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 10px; width:399; height:332">
  
  <br>
  
        Note: The images above are just examples. Try the extension to see different colors in action!
- P/M Languages supported: As long as the typing involves indentation, the extension will be compatible. This includes html, css, javascript, python, json, among others.
